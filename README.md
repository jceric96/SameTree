## Same Tree
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not 

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes
have the same value.

Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
